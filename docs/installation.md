## Configuration

- Once the config files for TAB plugin are generated, navigate to `..plugins/TAB/groups.yml`.
- Add the `%fancyglow_color%` placeholder to the end of the player's tagprefix as it has to be the last color in the
  prefix. Example configuration:

```yml title="groups.yml"
_DEFAULT_:
  tagprefix: '%vault-prefix%%fancyglow_color%'
```

!!! warning

    For Minecraft versions below `1.13` the prefix can't be longer than 14 characters due to a 16-character limit total (glow placeholder adds 2 characters which is `&` and the color code)
